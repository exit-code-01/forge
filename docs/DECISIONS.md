# Architecture Decisions

An ADR-lite log. Each entry captures a decision, why it was made, and enough
context that future-me doesn't relitigate it without new information.

## ADR-001 — Engine as a static library, executables stay thin

The engine is a static library (`forge::engine`); `sandbox` (and later
`editor`) are thin executables that link it. This forces a real public/private
boundary from day one: anything a consumer needs must be deliberately exposed,
not reached into. It keeps build times honest, makes the API surface reviewable,
and means the same engine binary backs every tool without a shared-object
loader dance. Shared libraries and plugin loading are deferred until there's a
concrete need.

## ADR-002 — Public headers under `engine/include/forge/`, privates under `engine/src/`

Public API headers live in `engine/include/forge/`; implementation and private
headers live in `engine/src/`. CMake exposes `include/` as PUBLIC and `src/` as
PRIVATE on the engine target, so consumers physically cannot include an
internal header — the include path isn't there. If sandbox ever needs an
engine internal, that's a signal to design a public API for it, not to widen
the include path. The `forge/` prefix namespaces our headers against any
dependency we vendor later.

## ADR-003 — Dependencies via pinned FetchContent, added only when first consumed

Third-party libraries come in through CMake FetchContent, pinned to a specific
commit/tag, and are added only when code actually consumes them — not
speculatively. At P0 there are none. This keeps the dependency graph minimal
and auditable, makes builds reproducible without a separate package manager,
and ensures every dependency has a real, traceable reason for being present.
Warning flags stay PRIVATE to our targets so third-party warnings never become
our problem.

## ADR-004 — GLFW over SDL2 for windowing and input

GLFW is our windowing/input library, chosen over SDL2. It has a smaller surface
area, a Vulkan-first design (`GLFW_NO_API` + `glfwCreateWindowSurface` fit our
renderer exactly), and no baggage from audio/gamepad/networking subsystems we
already cover with dedicated libraries. The choice is trivially reversible
because GLFW is fully encapsulated behind `forge::Window` — only `Window.cpp`
includes GLFW headers, and it does so under `#define GLFW_INCLUDE_NONE` (GLFW's
default of pulling in system OpenGL headers breaks on Vulkan-only machines that
lack `GL/gl.h`; the define is mandatory anywhere GLFW is included). Swapping to
SDL2 later would touch exactly one translation unit, not the whole codebase.

## ADR-005 — No `AlignConsecutive*` formatting; code conforms to the tool

Our canonical `.clang-format` deliberately leaves `AlignConsecutiveAssignments`
and `AlignConsecutiveDeclarations` off. Column-aligning consecutive `=` signs or
declarations looks tidy, but editing one line in an aligned block re-spaces its
neighbours, turning a one-line change into a multi-line diff that pollutes
`git blame` — a real cost over an 18–30 month project where blame is a debugging
tool, not decoration. So the formatter stays boring and the code conforms to the
tool rather than the reverse: no hand-aligned columns for clang-format to fight.
The rule and this rationale are cross-referenced in the header comment of
`.clang-format` itself, which is the canonical source. (Process note: an ADR
number only exists once it is a row in this file — referencing a number
elsewhere without logging it here is the violation that created this entry's
retroactive gap.)

## ADR-006 — Input: per-window state, latched edges, GLFW-mirrored keycodes

Input lives as per-window `forge::Input` state that GLFW callbacks write into
(via the window user-pointer) and game/editor code reads through `window.input()`.
Edge detection uses per-frame *latches* rather than the classic current-vs-previous
array diff: a press/release sets a flag that survives until the next `newFrame()`,
so a key tapped and released within a single frame is never lost — the diff
approach silently drops those sub-frame taps. `forge::Key` values numerically
mirror GLFW's keycodes 1:1, eliminating a translation table; the pairing is
enforced by `static_assert`s in `Input.cpp`, so a GLFW renumbering becomes a
compile error instead of a runtime bug. `GLFW_REPEAT` is deliberately ignored:
OS key-repeat is a text-input concern (a P7 char-callback matter), not gameplay
input — which is exactly why holding a key logs once through `wasKeyPressed` but
continuously through `isKeyDown`.

## ADR-007 — Logging: stable `FORGE_*` macros over a single `write()` choke point

Logging is a thin `forge::log::message()` template behind four macros
(`FORGE_TRACE/INFO/WARN/ERROR`) that all funnel through one `write(Level,
string_view)` function. The call-site contract — `FORGE_INFO("x = {}", x)` — has
not changed since P0, yet the backend has since grown timestamps, per-level ANSI
color, a runtime min-level filter, and a mutex: none of that touched a single
call site, which is the entire payoff of the choke point. Three deliberate
properties: (1) the level check happens *before* `std::format` runs, so a
filtered-out message costs one branch and never formats its arguments; (2) colors
and the TTY check are cached per-stream and auto-disabled when output is
redirected, so log files stay plain text; (3) the mutex wraps only the final
`fprintf`, because interleaved half-lines from two threads are worse than the
tiny cost of serializing the write. `std::format` (C++20) means no `printf`
format-string/argument mismatches — the compiler checks them. A file/async sink
is a P5+ concern; it will be another `write()` implementation, not an API change.

## ADR-008 — ECS: sparse-set storage with generational entity handles

The ECS uses sparse-set storage (the EnTT family, sized for readability over
raw speed): each component type `T` gets a `Pool<T>` holding a big holey `sparse`
array (entity index → dense slot) and two small packed arrays (`dense` entity
indices + parallel `data`). Iterating "every Transform" therefore walks one
contiguous array — the cache behavior that is the whole reason ECS exists.
Removal is O(1) swap-and-pop, which is *why* iteration order is unspecified and
why you must never remove a component from inside an `each()` over that same
pool. An `Entity` is not an object but a handle: a 32-bit slot index plus a 32-bit
generation counter. Destroying an entity bumps its slot's generation, so every
outstanding handle to that slot becomes detectably stale (`alive()` returns
false) instead of silently aliasing the slot's next occupant — the ABA bug made
impossible by construction. Freed indices are recycled to keep the arrays dense.
Threading is intentionally absent: the registry is single-threaded until systems
exist (P4+), at which point parallelism happens *across* systems, not inside the
registry. The two-component `each<A,B>()` walks A and filters by B; picking the
smaller pool to drive is a P4 optimization the API is already shaped to absorb.

## ADR-009 — Vulkan via volk; `VkInstance` ownership hidden behind `VulkanContext`

Vulkan entry points are loaded with volk (`volkInitialize` → `volkLoadInstance`),
not linked against `vulkan-1`. This is the decision that lets the engine *build*
on any machine — including CI — with only the pinned Vulkan-Headers and no LunarG
SDK installed: the loader is `dlopen`'d at runtime, so a driver-less box fails
loudly at construction (`"Vulkan loader not found"`) rather than failing to link.
The `VkInstance` lives inside `forge::VulkanContext`, RAII in the same shape as
`Window` (ctor acquires loader → instance → GPU enumeration; dtor destroys). Two
encapsulation choices matter: (1) the public header does *not* include any Vulkan
header — it forward-declares `VkInstance` via the same `typedef struct
VkInstance_T*` that Vulkan itself uses, which is byte-identical and standard-legal,
so `<volk.h>` stays confined to `VulkanContext.cpp`; (2) validation layers are
enabled only in debug builds and only when `VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation` is
actually present, so dev builds get the single highest-value Vulkan debugging
tool for free while ship builds and SDK-less machines simply log that it is off.
At P2.0 the context stops at enumeration — it lists GPUs and logs each one;
physical-device selection and queue families are P2.1.

## ADR-010 — Vulkan 1.3 minimum: dynamic rendering + sync2; scored device selection

The engine requires Vulkan 1.3 and renders with *dynamic rendering* plus
*synchronization2* — no `VkRenderPass`, no `VkFramebuffer`, ever. Render-pass
objects exist for tiler GPUs and add ~150 lines of ceremony per pass
configuration; dynamic rendering is the API shape modern engines (and our P3
PBR pass) actually want. Raising the floor to 1.3 is what buys this: hardware
that can't do 1.3 (2015-era GPUs) is not our audience. Device selection is a
scored filter, not a "pick first": a GPU is eligible only if it offers 1.3, a
graphics queue, present support *for our actual surface*, `VK_KHR_swapchain`,
and the two features above — then discrete beats integrated by a wide margin.
Ineligible hardware is skipped with a logged reason, never silently. Queue
policy: prefer one combined graphics+present family (virtually universal, lets
the swapchain use exclusive sharing); separate families are accepted as a
fallback. Process note: `Renderer.cpp` is the second and last TU that includes
GLFW — `glfwCreateWindowSurface` and nothing else — a deliberate, bounded
exception to ADR-004's "exactly one translation unit."

## ADR-011 — Shaders: checked-in SPIR-V, embedded into the binary by pure CMake

GLSL sources live in `engine/shaders/` next to their compiled `.spv`, and the
`.spv` is the *committed* artifact. At configure time, `cmake/EmbedShaders.cmake`
hex-dumps each `.spv` into a generated header of `uint32_t` arrays
(endian-corrected 32-bit words — exactly what `vkCreateShaderModule` wants), so
shaders are compiled into the executable. Three problems die at once: no
runtime shader paths to resolve (the classic "works from my IDE, breaks from
the terminal" bug), no Vulkan SDK required to *build* (CI and fresh clones stay
green — the same philosophy as volk in ADR-009), and no shader/binary version
skew. Committing a build artifact is normally a smell; here it is the
deliberate escape hatch that keeps `glslc` a dev-machine-only tool — the
`forge_shaders` CMake target (which only exists when the SDK is found)
recompiles GLSL → SPIR-V into the source tree, and the result gets committed
like any other change. This scheme is for the engine's own built-in shaders;
P5's asset pipeline owns user/game shaders and hot reload, and will replace
none of it.

## ADR-012 — Shader data policy and clip-space conventions live in ONE place

How data reaches shaders is a policy, not an ad-hoc choice per call site:
*per-frame* data (camera matrix, lights) goes in one persistently-mapped
uniform buffer per frame-in-flight, bound as descriptor set 0 — the fence that
guards the frame slot also makes its UBO safely writable, no extra sync;
*per-draw* data (model matrix) goes in push constants, staying within the
128-byte floor Vulkan guarantees (a mat4 is 64 — relying on the common 256 is
how you ship something that breaks on someone else's GPU); *per-mesh* data
(vertices/indices) is device-local, filled once through a staging buffer at
load time. Vulkan's clip-space differences from OpenGL are centralized in the
Renderer and nowhere else: `GLM_FORCE_DEPTH_ZERO_TO_ONE` is defined on the glm
*target* (a partial define is an ODR bug that renders as subtly-wrong depth),
the projection Y-flip (`proj[1][1] *= -1`) happens inside `drawFrame`, and the
resulting front-face winding (COUNTER_CLOCKWISE for CCW-authored geometry —
*empirically verified by painting normals as colors*, after a confident paper
derivation of CLOCKWISE shipped an inside-out cube) is set in exactly one
pipeline. Apps hand the engine a `Camera` and never learn Vulkan's axes.
Allocation stays raw vkAllocateMemory per buffer; VMA is the documented
trigger point when P5 asset streaming multiplies allocation counts.
